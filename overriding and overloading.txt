Overriding Rules
Overloading and its Rules

3 rules for overriding (we are discussing only 2 right now)
Rule 1 : - Weaker Access Rule
  - Scope of variables - private -> default -> protected -> public
    - private - accessible only within the class
    - default - can be accessed by any class but within same package
    - protected - can be accessed within package, can also be accessed outside the
      package using inheritance
    - public - can be accessed anywhere by any class...

Packages : Group of Classes
- we use packages to achieve modularity

Rule 2 : - Covariant Return Types



Overloading and its rules
- No of arguments can be changed
- Type of arguments can be changed
- Order of arguments can be changed
- IS-A is not mandatory
